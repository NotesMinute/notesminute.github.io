* The range could be as low as a few kilometers to as high as thousands of kilometers.

                <hr class="divider ml-0">
            <p class="mt-2"> * These missiles are usually launched from an aircraft to destroy targets on the surface of the earth. 

* The targets could be moving (not at very high speeds) but are normally stationary. 

* The launch point (aircraft) is in motion. Hence, it is possible to search and seek out targets whose positions or movements are not known beforehand. 

* In other words, the targets for such missiles are seldom predetermined as in the case of SSMs, which means that the missile must have some means of seeking out these targets. 

* This causes the additional problems of avoiding spurious signals from the ground. 

* Since it is possible to come close to the target, accuracy can also be improved. 
However, the launch point itself moves, and so the velocity and other dynamic properties of the aircraft must be taken into account in the guidance system.

* These missiles are primarily offensive weapons but can also be considered a defensive weapon system depending on their actual use.

            <p class="mt-2"> * Here, both the launch point and the target are aircraft. 

* These missiles are perhaps the most difficult to design and build. Both aircraft are in motion at high speeds. 

* They are also capable of high maneuverability. 

* Targets are small and difficult to locate. 

* The guidance system has to take into account all the factors mentioned for SAMs at the target end, and those mentioned for ASMs at the launch end. 

* In addition, the guidance system should be such that it should not prevent the aircraft which launches the missile from taking evasive actions for its own survival after the missile has been launched.

* These missiles can be used both as offensive and defensive weapon systems </p>

* Some examples of such missiles are : 
1) Gremlin SA-14 (CIS, 6 km)
2) MANPADS (France, 4-6 km)
3) Stinger (USA, 45 km)
4) Patriot (USA, 160 km).

            <p class="mt-2"> * These missiles are usually launched from an aircraft to destroy targets on the surface of the earth. 

* The targets could be moving (not at very high speeds) but are normally stationary. 

* The launch point (aircraft) is in motion. Hence, it is possible to search and seek out targets whose positions or movements are not known beforehand. 

* In other words, the targets for such missiles are seldom predetermined as in the case of SSMs, which means that the missile must have some means of seeking out these targets. 

* This causes the additional problems of avoiding spurious signals from the ground. 

* Since it is possible to come close to the target, accuracy can also be improved. 
However, the launch point itself moves, and so the velocity and other dynamic properties of the aircraft must be taken into account in the guidance system.

* These missiles are primarily offensive weapons but can also be considered a defensive weapon system depending on their actual use.

                <hr class="divider ml-0">
            <p class="mt-2"> * Here, both the launch point and the target are aircraft. 

* These missiles are perhaps the most difficult to design and build. Both aircraft are in motion at high speeds. 

* They are also capable of high maneuverability. 

* Targets are small and difficult to locate. 

* The guidance system has to take into account all the factors mentioned for SAMs at the target end, and those mentioned for ASMs at the launch end. 

* In addition, the guidance system should be such that it should not prevent the aircraft which launches the missile from taking evasive actions for its own survival after the missile has been launched.

* These missiles can be used both as offensive and defensive weapon systems </p>
